# nexushub


this is my first script hub for roblox, frankly its kind of ass and it sucks and some of it doesn't work but it was a big step for me. have fun with it i guess, heres the loadstring: loadstring(game:HttpGet(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yyyyeattwer/nexushub/refs/heads/main/main.lua))()
